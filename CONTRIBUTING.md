# Contributing to pipellm

Hi there! Thank you for even being interested in contributing to `pipellm`.
As an open source project in a rapidly developing field, we are extremely open
to contributions, whether it be in the form of a new feature, improved infra, or better documentation.

To contribute to this project, please follow a ["fork and pull request"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) workflow.
Please do not try to push directly to this repo unless you are maintainer.

## Contributing Guidelines

### GitHub Issues

Our [issues](https://github.com/xinqiu/pipellm/issues) page is kept up to date
with bugs, improvements, and feature requests. There is a taxonomy of labels to help
with sorting and discovery of issues of interest.

If you are adding an issue, please try to keep it focused on a single modular bug/improvement/feature.
If the two issues are related, or blocking, please link them rather than keep them as one single one.

We will try to keep these issues as up to date as possible, though
with the rapid rate of develop in this field some may get out of date.
If you notice this happening, please just let us know.
