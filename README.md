pipelang: Pipeline framework for large language models

## Quick Install

```
go get github.com/index-labs/pipelang
```

## What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling
developers to build applications that they previously could not.
But using these LLMs in isolation is often not enough to
create a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.
